# Capacitive Touch Sensor with LED Toggle

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of a capacitive touch sensor to toggle an LED on and off with a simple touch. The capacitive touch sensor detects changes in capacitance caused by touch, allowing for touch-based interactions.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Uno**
2. **Capacitive Touch Sensor**
3. **LED**
4. **Resistor (for the LED)**
5. **Jumper Wires**

### Block Diagram



#### Pin Connections

- **Capacitive Touch Sensor:**
  - Signal Pin: Connect to digital pin 2 (touchPin) on the Arduino Uno.
  - VCC: Connect to Arduino 5V or 3.3V (check sensor specifications).
  - GND: Connect to Arduino GND.

- **LED:**
  - Anode (+): Connect to digital pin 13 (ledPin) on the Arduino Uno through a current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220Œ©).
  - Cathode (-): Connect to Arduino GND.

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the capacitive touch sensor to digital pin 2 (touchPin) on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the LED's anode (positive) pin to digital pin 13 (ledPin) on the Arduino Uno, and its cathode (negative) pin to GND through a current-limiting resistor.

2. **Initialize the System:**
   - Set the touchPin as an input and the ledPin as an output in the setup function.

3. **Read Touch Sensor State:**
   - Continuously read the state of the touch sensor using `digitalRead(touchPin)` in the loop function.

4. **Toggle LED on Touch:**
   - If the touch sensor is touched (HIGH state), toggle the state of the LED using `digitalWrite(ledPin, !digitalRead(ledPin))`.
   - Add a small delay (`delay(200)`) to debounce the touch input and prevent rapid toggling.

#### Applications

- **Interactive Displays:** Implement touch-sensitive interfaces for interactive displays or panels.
- **Control Systems:** Use touch sensors for user input in control systems or home automation projects.
- **Proximity Detection:** Detect proximity or touch without physical contact for various applications.

#### Notes

- Adjust the delay time according to the sensitivity of the touch sensor and the desired response time.
- Ensure proper grounding and insulation to avoid false triggers or interference.
