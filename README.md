# Arduino Uno Touch Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a capacitive touch sensor module with an Arduino Uno. The touch sensor detects touch or proximity, triggering an action in response to the input.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Capacitive Touch Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Touch Sensor Module to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the touch sensor module to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the power (VCC) and ground (GND) of the touch sensor module to the respective power and ground pins on the Arduino Uno.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the touch sensor module to the Arduino Uno as per the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the output indicating "Touch detected" or "No touch detected" based on sensor input.

#### Applications

- **Interactive Projects:** Use in projects where touch-based input is required, such as interactive displays or input controls.
- **Proximity Sensing:** Implement proximity sensing applications without physical contact.
- **Education and Prototyping:** Learn about capacitive touch sensing principles and Arduino integration.

#### Notes

- Ensure the touch sensor module is positioned correctly and calibrated as per its specifications.
- Experiment with sensitivity adjustments and debounce techniques for reliable touch detection.
- Explore advanced capacitive touch sensor modules for extended functionality and integration possibilities.
